# Univariate Linear Regression with Feature Scaling

This repository contains an implementation of univariate linear regression with feature scaling in Python. The code demonstrates how to perform gradient descent optimization to find the best-fit line for predicting house prices based on their sizes. It also includes feature scaling using z-score normalization to ensure that the features are on a similar scale. The model is using self-defined gradient descent z-score normalization functions as this project was made to understand how these concepts work

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages by running the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `linear_regression.py` file.

2. Make sure you have a CSV file (`Daegu_Real_Estate_data.csv`) containing the dataset you want to use for regression. Adjust the file path in the code if necessary.

3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

4. The script will output the calculated slope and intercept of the regression line, as well as display a scatter plot of the data points and the fitted line.
